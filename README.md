# nbs-irc
Fork of latest nbs-irc code to add support for various modern [mIRC](http://www.mirc.co.uk/) features.
This is based off nbs-irc v2.39-110803 (about box lists it as build 120128), downloadable from [nbs-irc.net](http://nbs-irc.net/). A copy of the latest official installers are provided at the [releases section](https://github.com/ElectronicWar/nbs-irc/releases) in case the original homepage goes down.

## Requirements
My changes require the usage of mIRC 7.33 or newer and are always developed using the latest release (v7.41).
